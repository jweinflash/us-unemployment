##### Examining how unemployment varies in the US over time

hrbrmstr has a nice post about participating in Andy Kriebel's [data visualization workouts](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) using `R`. See the  link below for his take on the week's workout. As he says, the best way to improve with this stuff is to actually practice doing it. So I thought I'd give it a try and participate myself.

One thing I liked about [hrbrmstr](https://rud.is/b/2017/01/18/workout-wednesday-redux-2017-week-3/) and [Andy's](http://www.vizwiz.com/2017/01/workout-wednesday-state-of-us-jobs.html) visualizations (as well as [Matt's](http://thedailyviz.com/2016/12/14/four-decades-of-state-unemployment-rates-in-small-multiples-part-2/), the original author) is how each state's unemployment data is shown as a number *relative* to the national average. This is nice. It jumped out at me though that under this view  we lose sight of how the nation is trending on its own. Is employment generally going up? down? We can't tell, because all we see is how the state is trending relative to the rest of the country.

With this in mind, I thought I'd try to build on their charts by constructing one that show's each state's data unnormalized, *overlaying* this with the national average. In this way, we see each state's raw unemployment figures, as well as a comparison to see how things are going relative to the rest of the country. See below for the chart, and below that for the code that was used to build it.<br><br>

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 11, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics("../plots/us-unemployment.png")
```
<br>
```{r code = readLines("main.R")}
```
